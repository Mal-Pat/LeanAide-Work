# Problem Statements

This file contains only the problem statements.

1. The sum of an even natural number and an odd natural number is an odd natural number.

2. Given two natural numbers x and y, either x is less than y (x < y), or x is greater than y (x > y), or x is equal to y (x = y).

3. Addition of two natural numbers is commutative, that is, x + y = y + x.

4. 11 is a prime number.

5. If a number is prime, then it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

6. The product of two odd numbers is always an odd number.

7. If a number expressed in decimal notation ends with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, then it is divisible by 2.

8. If a number is divisible by 12, then it is divisible by 3.

9. All numbers of the form (3*n + 2) leave remainder 2 when divided by 3.

10. The LCM of 6 and 9 is 18.

11. The GCD of 6 and 9 is 3.

12. If an integer x divides an integer y, and y divides an integer z, then x divides z.

13. If an integer x divides an integer y, and x divides an integer z, then x divides (y + z).
