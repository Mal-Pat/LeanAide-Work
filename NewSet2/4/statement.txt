Statement:

The product of two odd numbers is an odd number

Proof:

Definition 1 (Odd integer). An integer n is odd precisely if there exists an integer k such that  
 n = 2k + 1.  

Theorem. For any integers m and n, if m is odd and n is odd then m·n is odd.  

Proof.  

Step 1. (Hypotheses)  
H1: m ∈ ℤ and m is odd.  
H2: n ∈ ℤ and n is odd.  

Step 2. (Goal: express m in the form 2k₁ + 1)  
From H1 and Definition 1 there exists k₁ ∈ ℤ such that  
 m = 2k₁ + 1.  

Step 3. (Goal: express n in the form 2k₂ + 1)  
From H2 and Definition 1 there exists k₂ ∈ ℤ such that  
 n = 2k₂ + 1.  

Step 4. (Goal: express the product p = m·n in the form 2s + 1)  
Define p = m·n.  
Then  
 p = (2k₁ + 1)(2k₂ + 1)  
   = 4k₁k₂ + 2k₁ + 2k₂ + 1  
   = 2(2k₁k₂ + k₁ + k₂) + 1.  
Define s = 2k₁k₂ + k₁ + k₂.  

Step 5. (Goal: s is an integer)  
k₁ ∈ ℤ and k₂ ∈ ℤ.  
Closure of ℤ under multiplication and addition implies s ∈ ℤ.  

Step 6. (Goal: conclude p is odd)  
From Step 4 and Step 5 there exists s ∈ ℤ such that  
 p = 2s + 1.  
By Definition 1, p is odd.  

Conclusion. Under hypotheses H1 and H2, the product m·n is odd.
