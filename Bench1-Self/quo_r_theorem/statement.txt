For any natural numbers $a$ and $b$, if $b % a = r$ (remainder of $b$ divided by $a$ is $r$), then there exists $q$ such that $b = a * q + r$.

Proof:
For any natural numbers $a$ and $b$,
From Quotient-Remainder Theorem,
$b % a = r$ implies there exists a natural number $q$ such that $b = a * q + r$.
