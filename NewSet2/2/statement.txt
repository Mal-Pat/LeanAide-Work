Statement:

If a number is divisible by 12, then it is divisible by 3

Proof:

Definition 1 (Divisibility). For integers d and x, Divisible(d,x) holds if and only if there exists an integer y such that  
 x = d · y.

Theorem. For every integer n, Divisible(12,n) implies Divisible(3,n).

Proof.

Let n be an arbitrary integer.  
Goal G₀: Prove Divisible(12,n) → Divisible(3,n).

Statement A₁: Divisible(12,n).  
From A₁ and Definition 1, there exists an integer k such that  
 n = 12 · k.  
Definition 2: Denote by k₁₂ an integer satisfying n = 12 · k₁₂.

Goal G₁: Prove Divisible(3,n).

Calculation C₁:  
 n = 12 · k₁₂  
   = (3 · 4) · k₁₂          (since 12 = 3 · 4)  
   = 3 · (4 · k₁₂)          (by associativity of multiplication).

Definition 3: Denote by m the integer m := 4 · k₁₂.

From Calculation C₁ and Definition 3,  
 n = 3 · m.

Conclusion C₂: Divisible(3,n) holds by Definition 1 with witness m.

Conclusion C₃: Divisible(12,n) → Divisible(3,n) follows from A₁ and C₂.

Conclusion C₄: For every integer n, Divisible(12,n) implies Divisible(3,n).∎
