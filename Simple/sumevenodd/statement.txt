The sum of an even number and an odd number is an odd number.


Theorem:
For all integers p and q, p is even implies q is odd implies (p + q) is odd.

Proof:
By definition, since p is even, there exists an integer k1 such that p = 2 * k1.
By definition, since q is odd, there exists an integer k2 such that q =  2 * k2 + 1.

Substituting this in p + q,
we get p + q = 2 * k1 + 2 * k2 + 1 = 2 * (k1 + k2) + 1,
which is of the form of an odd number.

Thus, p + q is odd.
