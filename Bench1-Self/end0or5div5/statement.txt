If the last digit of a number is 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5.

Proof:
Let the number be $n$.

Case 1:
If $n % 10 = 0$,
It implies 10 divides $n$,
Which implies there exists $k$ such that $n = 10 * k$,
Which implies there exists $k$ such that $n = 5 * (2 * k)$,
Which implies 5 divides $n$.

Case 2:
If $n % 10 = 5$,
It implies there exists $k$ such that $n = 10 * k + 5$,
Which implies there exists $k$ such that $n = 5 * (2 * k + 1)$,
Which implies 5 divides $n$.

In both cases, 5 divides $n$.
Thus, if the last digit of a number is 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5.
