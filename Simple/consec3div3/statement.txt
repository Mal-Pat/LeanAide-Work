The sum of any three consecutive numbers (n, n+1, n+2) is divisible by 3.


Theorem: 3 | (n + (n + 1) + (n + 2))

Proof:

Take 3 | (n + (n + 1) + (n + 2)).

Simplify to 3 | (3 * n + 3).

Which simplifies to 3 | 3 * (n + 1).

Trivially, 3 divides 3 * (n + 1).

Thus, 3 divides (n + (n + 1) + (n + 2)).
