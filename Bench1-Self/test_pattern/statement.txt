If the remainder of dividing a natural number $n$ by 6 is 0 or 4, then $n$ is not prime.

Proof:
For any natural number $n$,

Case 1:
If $n % 6 = 0$,
Then there exists a natural number $k$ such that $n = 6 * k$.
Clearly, 6 is a factor of $n$.
Hence, $n$ is not prime.

Case 2:
If $n % 6 = 4$,
Then there exists a natural number $k$ such that $n = 6 * k + 4$.
That implies there exists $k$ such that $n = 2 * (3 * k + 2)$.
Clearly, $n$ is an even number greater than 2.
Hence, $n$ is not prime.

Thus, in both cases, $n$ is not prime.
