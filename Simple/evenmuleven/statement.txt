Multiplying any number with an even number gives an even number.


Theorem:
For all integers p and q, p is Even implies p * q is Even.

Proof:
An integer n is defined as even if there exists an integer k such that n = 2 * k.

Since p is even, there exists an integer k such that p = 2 * k.

Hence, p * q = 2 * k * q.

Since p * q can be written as 2 * (k * q), it is even.

Thus, p * q is even.
