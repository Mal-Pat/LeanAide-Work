Statement:
For all natural numbers $n$, there exists a natural number $m$ such that $m - n > n$.

Proof:
For any natural number $n$,
Let $m$ be $n + (n + 1)$.
Assert $n + 1 > n$.
Then, $m - n = n + (n + 1) - n = n + 1 > n$, by our assertion.
Thus, for all natural numbers $n$, there exists a natural number $m$ such that $m - n > n$.
