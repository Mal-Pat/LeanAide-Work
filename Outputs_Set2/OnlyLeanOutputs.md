> The entire space X is a closed set in any topological space.

### 7.

> The union of any finite collection of closed sets is a closed set.

### 8.

> The intersection of any collection (finite or infinite) of closed sets is a closed set.

### 9.

> A set is open if and only if its complement is closed.

### 10.

> In a metric space, an open ball (or open disk) is an open set.

### 11.

### 12.

> The identity function from a topological space to itself is continuous.

### 13.

> The interior of any set in a topological space is an open set.

### 14.
