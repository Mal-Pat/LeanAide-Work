Statement:
There exists a real number $m$, such that for all natural numbers $n > 1$, $m^n < m$.

Proof:
Let the real number $m$ be 0.5
Clearly, 0.5 < 1
For any natural number $n > 1$,
$0.5^n < 0.5$, since raising a number less than 1 to a power greater than 1 makes the number smaller.
Hence, there exists a real number $m$, such that for all natural numbers $n > 1$, $m^n < m$.
