If a number ends with 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5.


Theorem: For all n : Integer, 5 | (10 * n) and 5 | (10 * n + 5).

First case: 
For all n : Integer, 5 | (10 * n)

Implies 
For all n : Integer, 5 | 5 * (2 * n)

Implies
True

Second case:
For all n : Integer, 5 | (10 * n + 5)

Implies
For all n : Integer, 5 | 5 * (2 * n + 1)

Implies
True

Hence, from both cases,

For all n : Integer, 5 | (10 * n) and 5 | (10 * n + 5)
is True.
