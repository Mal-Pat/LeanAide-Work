Statement:
For all natural numbers $n$, there exists a natural number $m$ such that $m - n > n$.

Proof:
**Lemma add_sub_eq**  
Statement. For all natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\),  
\[
a + b - b = a.
\]  
Proof. The identity follows from Lean’s `nat.add_sub_cancel_left` lemma, which asserts precisely that for any \(a,b:\mathbb{N}\), \(a + b - b = a\).  

**Lemma succ_lt**  
Statement. For every natural number \(n\),  
\[
n < n + 1.
\]  
Proof. This inequality is exactly `nat.lt_succ_self` in Lean’s core library, which states that each natural number is strictly less than its successor.  

**Theorem**  
Statement. For every natural number \(n\), there exists a natural number \(m\) such that \(m - n > n\).  

Proof.  
Assume \(n : \mathbb{N}\).  
Define \(m : \mathbb{N} := n + (n + 1)\).  
  
We aim to show \(m - n > n\).  
  
1. By Lemma add_sub_eq with \(a := n\) and \(b := n\),  
   \[
   m - n \;=\; \bigl(n + (n + 1)\bigr) - n 
   =\; (n + n) + 1 - n
   =\; n + 1.
   \]  
2. By Lemma succ_lt applied to \(n\),  
   \[
   n < n + 1.
   \]  
3. Hence \(m - n = n + 1 > n\).  

Therefore, \(\exists m : \mathbb{N},\; m - n > n\).
