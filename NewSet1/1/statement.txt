Statement:

The sum of an even number and an odd number is an odd number

Proof:

Definitions  
D1. Integer x is even ⟺ ∃k ∈ ℤ: x = 2k.  
D2. Integer x is odd  ⟺ ∃ℓ ∈ ℤ: x = 2ℓ + 1.

Proof  
1. Let m ∈ ℤ satisfy ∃k ∈ ℤ: m = 2k.  
   Goal 1: Introduce an arbitrary even integer m.  
2. Let n ∈ ℤ satisfy ∃ℓ ∈ ℤ: n = 2ℓ + 1.  
   Goal 2: Introduce an arbitrary odd integer n.  
3. Define s := m + n.  
   Goal 3: Introduce the sum s of m and n.  
4. s = m + n = 2k + (2ℓ + 1).  
   Goal 4: Express s in terms of k and ℓ.  
5. s = 2(k + ℓ) + 1.  
   Goal 5: Rewrite s in the form 2p + 1.  
6. Let p := k + ℓ. Then p ∈ ℤ.  
   Goal 6: Introduce p as an integer.  
7. s = 2p + 1 with p ∈ ℤ.  
   Goal 7: Verify that s satisfies the odd‐integer definition D2.  
8. From Step 7 and D2, conclude s is odd.  
Conclusion  
For all m ∈ ℤ and n ∈ ℤ, if m is even and n is odd, then m + n is odd.
