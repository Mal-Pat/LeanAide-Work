For any natural numbers $a$ and $b$, $b % a = 0$ (remainder on dividing $b$ by $a$ is 0) is equivalent to $a$ divides $b$.

Proof:
For any natural numbers $a$ and $b$,
From Quotient-Remainder Theorem, $b % a = 0$ is equivalent to there exists $q$ such that $b = a * q + 0$.
Clearly, $a * q + 0 = a * q$, and $a$ divides $a * q$.
Hence, $a$ divides $b$.
Thus, $b % a = 0$ is equivalent to $a$ divides $b$.
