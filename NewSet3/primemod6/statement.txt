For all primes other than 2 and 3, dividing the prime by 6 gives remainder 1 or 5 (that is, for all primes p such that p!=2 and p!=3, p mod 6 = 1 or p mod 6 = 5).


Lemma 1. Let $n:\mathbb Z$. Then there exist $k:\mathbb Z$ and $r:\mathbb N$ such that $0 \le r < 6$ and $n = 6\,k + r$.

Proof. By the division algorithm on divisor $6$, there exist $q:\mathbb Z$ and $r_0:\mathbb N$ satisfying $0 \le r_0 < 6$ and $n = 6\,q + r_0$. Define $k := q$ and $r := r_0$. Then $0 \le r < 6$ and $n = 6\,k + r$.

Theorem. Let $p$ be a prime, $h_2 : p \neq 2$, and $h_3 : p \neq 3$. Then $p \bmod 6 = 1$ or $p \bmod 6 = 5$.

Proof. Apply Lemma 1 to $n := p$ to obtain $k : \mathbb Z$, $r : \mathbb N$, $h_{r1} : 0 \le r < 6$, and $h_{r2} : p = 6\,k + r$. Perform case analysis on $r$:

Case $r = 0$. From $h_{r2}$ deduce $6 \mid p$, hence $2 \mid p$ and $3 \mid p$. By primality of $p$, $p = 2$ or $p = 3$, contradicting $h_2$ and $h_3$.

Case $r = 1$. From $h_{r2}$ and $0 \le 1 < 6$ deduce $p \bmod 6 = 1$.

Case $r = 2$. From $h_{r2}$ deduce $2 \mid p$. By primality of $p$, $p = 2$, contradicting $h_2$.

Case $r = 3$. From $h_{r2}$ deduce $3 \mid p$. By primality of $p$, $p = 3$, contradicting $h_3$.

Case $r = 4$. From $h_{r2}$ deduce $2 \mid p$. By primality of $p$, $p = 2$, contradicting $h_2$.

Case $r = 5$. From $h_{r2}$ and $0 \le 5 < 6$ deduce $p \bmod 6 = 5$.

Cases $r=1$ and $r=5$ yield the conclusion; all other cases contradict the assumptions.
