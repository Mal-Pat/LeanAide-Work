      "abstract": "This document provides a formal proof of the Trichotomy Law for natural numbers, stating that for any two natural numbers x and y, exactly one of the following relations holds: x is less than y (x < y), x is greater than y (x > y), or x is equal to y (x = y). The proof relies on fundamental definitions of natural numbers, their ordering based on addition, and the Principle of Mathematical Induction."
