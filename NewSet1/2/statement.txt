Statement:

If a number is divisible by 12, then it is divisible by 3

Proof:

Definition 1 (Divisibility).  For integers a and b, “a divides b” means  
∃d∈ℤ such that b = a·d.

Theorem.  For every integer n, if 12 divides n then 3 divides n.

Proof.  
1.  Let n be an integer.  
2.  Hypothesis H₁: 12 divides n.  
3.  From H₁ and Definition 1,  
    ∃k∈ℤ such that n = 12·k.  
4.  Goal: ∃m∈ℤ such that n = 3·m.  
5.  Define m = 4·k.  
6.  k∈ℤ and 4∈ℤ imply m∈ℤ.  
7.  n = 12·k = 3·(4·k) = 3·m.  
8.  From steps 6–7, ∃m∈ℤ such that n = 3·m.  
9.  From Definition 1 and step 8, 3 divides n.
