The sum of an even number $a$ and an odd number $b$ is an odd number.

Proof:
Since $a$ is even, there exists $k$ such that $a = 2 * k$.
Since $b$ is odd, there exists $m$ such that $b = 2 * m + 1$.
So, $a + b = (2 * k) + (2 * m + 1) = 2 * (k + m) + 1$.
Clearly, $2 * (k + m) + 1$ is odd.
That implies $a + b$ is odd.
Hence, the sum of an even and odd number is odd.
