Statement:

If a number is greater than 5, then it is greater than 2

Proof:

Definition 1. ℝ denotes the set of real numbers.

Definition 2. The symbol “>” denotes the standard strict order on ℝ.

Definition 3 (Transitivity of “>”).  
∀ a,b,c ∈ ℝ, if a > b and b > c then a > c.

Fact 1. 5 ∈ ℝ and 2 ∈ ℝ.

Fact 2. 5 > 2.

Theorem. ∀ x ∈ ℝ, if x > 5 then x > 2.

Proof.  
Step 1 (Introduction).  
Let x ∈ ℝ satisfy H₁: x > 5.  
Goal G₁: x > 2.

Step 2 (Application of Transitivity).  
By Definition 3 with a := x, b := 5, c := 2, using H₁ and Fact 2, conclude C₁: x > 2.

Step 3 (Conclusion).  
C₁ establishes G₁.
